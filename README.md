## Your Tutorial

In this tutorial, I'll walk you through the process of creating a console application using Rust to interact with the Stellar network. The application connects to the Horizon Stellar network, performs API queries, and leverages Rust crates for API abstraction. By the end of this guide, you'll have a functional terminal user interface (TUI) application for Stellar network interactions.

## What I Created

For the Build Better on Stellar Smart Contract Challenge, I developed a console-based application with a terminal user interface (TUI) to interface with the Stellar Horizon network. The project involved making direct API requests to the Stellar Horizon API and using Rust crates to abstract these queries. The application integrates Stellar network functionalities, allowing users to interact with the network via a terminal interface.

In the initial version, the application supports:

* Connecting to the Stellar network through various available wallets.
* Performing queries directly to the Stellar Horizon API.
* Utilizing Rust crates for streamlined API interactions.

## Journey

My journey began with learning how to perform direct API requests to the Stellar Horizon network. I explored different Rust crates that provide abstractions for these API calls, which made handling the interactions more manageable and efficient. I also delved into Stellar wallets, understanding how to establish connections and use them effectively within the application.

The project highlighted the need for better information handling and display. As a next step, I plan to integrate the ratatui crate to enhance the terminal interface, improving the overall user experience. This addition will help create a more interactive and visually appealing TUI.

Overall, this challenge has been a valuable learning experience, providing insights into Stellar network interactions and Rust programming. Iâ€™m excited to continue developing this application, refining its features, and improving its user interface.

I'm also incredibly hopeful about attending Meridian 2024â€”fingers crossed that everything works out for this project! ðŸŒŸ
